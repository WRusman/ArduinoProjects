This file is to help you use this routine.

1.Basic Information：
This routine was developed based on Arduino, and the routines were verified on the Arduino UNO.
This routine was verified using the e-Paper Shield module.

2.Pin connection：
Pin connections can be viewed in DEV_Config.h and will be repeated here:
e-Paper Shield   =>    Arduino
SCLK             ->    D13
MISO             ->    D12
MOSI             ->    D11
EPD_CS           ->    D10
EPD_DC           ->    D9
EPD_RST          ->    D8
EPD_BUSY         ->    D7
SD_CS_0          ->    D6
SPIRAM_CS        ->    D5


3.Basic use：
Since this project is a comprehensive project, you may need to read the following for use:
If you use the SD routine, you need to format the SD card to FAT32 format, and then put all the picture files in the BMP.
Copy to the root directory, note that the image is placed in the root directory, not the BMP folder is placed in the root directory.
method 1:
    Copy the entire EPD folder to the libraries folder under the Arduino installation path.
        ..\Arduino\libraries
Method 2:
    Copy the src folder in the EPD folder to
        C:\Users\user_name\Documents\Arduino\libraries
        or ..\document\Arduino\libraries

Then open the corresponding project burn in the examples folder.
