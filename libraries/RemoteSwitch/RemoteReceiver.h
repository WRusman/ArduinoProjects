/**
* See RemoteSwitch for introduction.
*
* RemoteReceiver decodes the signal received from a 433MHz-receiver, like the "KlikAanKlikUit"-system
* as well as the signal sent by the RemoteSwtich class. When a correct signal is received,
* a user-defined callback function is called.
*
* Note that in the callback function, the interrupts are still disabled. You can enabled them, if needed.
* A call to the callback must b finished before RemoteReceiver will call the callback function again, thus
* there is no re-entrant problem.
*
* When sending your own code using RemoteSwich, disable() the receiver first.
*
* This is a pure static class, for simplicity and to limit memory-use.
